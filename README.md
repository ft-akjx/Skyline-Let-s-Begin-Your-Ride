# Skyline-Let-s-Begin-Your-Ride
Have you ever imagined a modern, innovative, and easy-to-use vehicle?
Me too— because let's be honest, who hasn't? That's why we created Skyline — a project designed to shape the future of transportation.

Based on aerial cable cars, Skyline offers a whole new way to move across the city — just like a bus, but in the air.

We are Group #2, and we're reimagining urban mobility.

-Skyline, let's begin your ride.
